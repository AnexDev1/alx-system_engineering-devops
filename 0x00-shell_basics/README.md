The script 4-listmorefiles is a simple bash script that displays the contents of the current directory in a long format, including hidden files (files that start with a dot .). The script uses the ls command with the -al options, which tells ls to display the contents in a long format and to include hidden files. The output of the script shows information such as file permissions, the number of links, the owner and group of the file, the file size, and the modification time.
